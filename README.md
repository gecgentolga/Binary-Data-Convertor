*If the selected data type is floating point number, you will use IEEE-like format. The number of
exponent bits according to given data size will be like the following:

o if 1 byte (i.e., 8 bits), 4 bits will be used for exponent part

o if 2 bytes (i.e., 16 bits), 6 bits will be used for exponent part

o if 3 bytes (i.e., 24 bits), 8 bits will be used for exponent part

o if 4 bytes (i.e., 32 bits), 10 bits will be used for exponent part


*** You need to import an input.txt file inside the project.***

Example: input.txt
f0 90 01 40 03 00 ff ff 00 00 e0 7f
00 00 e0 ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80
00 00 18 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
